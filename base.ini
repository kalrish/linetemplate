% Depending on the output format, additional setup might be needed.
% The files base-dvi.ini and base-pdf.ini contain the necessary instructions for the DVI and PDF formats, respectively.
% Since there's no notion of output file format in iniTeX mode, we need another way to know which of them to include. We use the jobname for that.
% An alternative would have been to have those files explicitly include this one, but that's upside down and would involve repeating ourselves.
